Copyright Infringement PC-9801
===============================

This is the PC-9801 port of CI Regressive Right.
Unlike the PC-88 version, this one features more voiced samples.
It also one features support for 86- based boards and Mate-X.

Other than that, it's a typical porn game for the PC-9801 !
An enhanced PC-9821 version (and possibly PC-88VA) will come soon.

Requirements
=============

Minimum (will work but won't be totally smooth) : 
- Fast 286/V30 processor
- Can support 16 colors at 640x400 (Mid 85's PC9801)
- 640kb of free RAM

Recommended : 
- 386/486 processor (at least 20 mhz)

Note that 86- support consumes slightly more memory.

Usage
======

This game acts as a PC-Booter as to have the maximum amount of memory available as it is very
demanding on memory.
Simply insert the floppy disk (make sure it's turned off) and power it on.
It should autoboot to its own text-based menu asking you which sound card setup you want to use.

If you only have a -86 soundcard, choose the first option.
Otherwise, if you own a Mate-X based (later desktops), Speak board, Otomi-chanx or Chibi-Oto, select the 2nd option.
CanBe may work with this but is untested. SoundBlaster 16 is not supported at this time.

Once you selected your option, press Enter and it should boot into the game.

Boot on HDD
===========

If you don't want to boot this from the floppy drive,
you can also copy the files to an HDD (there is no copy protection).

You can simply do "RUN.BAT" or "AUTOEXEC.BAT" to run the game as you would from a floppy.
Be careful however : the game requires plenty of conventional memory !

Later DOS versions consume so much of it, it basically won't work.
FreeDOS(98) unmodified won't work also as it also consumes too much memory,
especially FreeCOM98 that it uses. 
(You can replace it with your own instead or use the one from DOS 2.0 that has been open sourced)
