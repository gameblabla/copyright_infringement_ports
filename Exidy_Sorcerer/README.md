Copyright Infringement for the Exidy Sorcerer
==============================================

An attempt at porting this game to the Exidy Sorcerer.
This computer is extremely primitive even back then. 
I would argue it's perhaps slightly better than the Commodore PET but that's about it...

Usage
======

With MAME, run it like so 
```
mame sorcererd -cassette1 $PWD/copyright_infringement_sorcerer.wav  -autoboot_delay 2 -autoboot_command "LO\nGO 0100\n" -window
```
Once it's loaded (you can fast forward with F10 after you enabled the UI controls again), type GO 0100.

On an actual Exidy sorcerer or compatible, you would do something similar except you would either burn this on an actual casette
or use something like your computer and phone and play the audio file on that.

LO

Then play the casette/audio file.
Once it's loaded, type GO 0100.
