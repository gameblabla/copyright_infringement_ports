Copyright Infringement PMD-85 version
======================================

Here's the PMD-85 version of the game.
Sadly it's not as good as i wanted it to be, in part because
the ZX1 decompressor was extremely slow on this machine so i had to resort
to reducing the frame's size.

This version takes advantage of ColorAce if you have it on your machine
however it will work in B&W too.

This was a mostly straight forward machine.
I was confused at first until i looked at the memory map on MAME then it was mostly straight forward.
I encountered Intel 8080 specific issues especially since it's still not fully supported
so i had to import my own copies of ZX1 and ZX0.
