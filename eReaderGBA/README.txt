Story
=====

Once upon a time, in a small town on the outskirts of Tokyo, lived a kind-hearted boy named Hiroshi. 

He was known throughout the community for his gentle nature, a spirit untouched by malice, harboring the kind of innocence that was as refreshing as the morning dew.

Life, however, had other plans. One fateful day, while returning from school, Hiroshi stumbled upon an ancient artifact, a mirror with a frame adorned with strange, 

twisted figures that looked like they were in agony. Unaware of its ominous significance, Hiroshi took it home, an action that would alter his life's course.

Later that night, as Hiroshi looked at his reflection, the mirror came to life. Suddenly, Hiroshi found himself not in his bedroom but in a place that bore a haunting resemblance to Hell. 

A land of searing heat and cruel, relentless creatures.

And then, from the darkest shadows, stepped forth a menacing figure. A sinister smile stretched across his face, and his eyes held a malicious gleam.

"Welcome, Hiroshi," the figure spoke, his voice echoing off the walls of the fiery abyss. "I am Rikuto. And you, my dear boy, are about to become my perfect plaything."

He challenged Hiroshi to a series of impossible trials, each more formidable than the last. Rikuto's laughter echoed through the fiery chambers, as he taunted the young boy with the prospect of everlasting torment.

But Hiroshi wasn't about to give in easily. He summoned all his courage, all his kindness, and all his purity, facing Rikuto's trials one after another. 

The trials were brutal, designed to break his spirit and rob him of his innocence.

Yet, the innocent boy from the peaceful Japanese town did not break. He fought and suffered, but never gave up. Each trial left him more determined, each torment made him stronger.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Hiroshi found a way back to his world. But he was not the same innocent boy. His eyes, once filled with light and wonder, were now marked with the shadows of the ordeal he had gone through.

While he managed to escape Rikuto's cruel games, the experience had left a deep scar on his soul. 

However, the trials also revealed an inner strength Hiroshi hadn't known he possessed. From then on, he dedicated his life to ensuring that no other innocent soul would suffer the torment he had endured.

He became a protector, a beacon of hope, a living testament to the indomitable spirit of goodness. Despite the darkness that had tried to consume him, Hiroshi's inner light continued to shine brighter, forever illuminating his path and those of others around him.


Night after night, Hiroshi would relive the horrors he had faced in the depths of that otherworldly realm. 

His dreams were painted with images of flames and shadows, and the haunting echoes of Rikuto's cruel laughter. He remembered every moment, every twisted game, every impossible trial that Rikuto had put him through.

One memory, in particular, continued to torment him. It was a trial where Hiroshi was forced to navigate through a maze filled with monstrous creatures. 

Each time he would get caught, he would be thrown back to the start, his wounds healing, only for the horrific chase to begin anew.

Hiroshi remembered breaking down, collapsing to the ground, hot tears streaming down his cheeks as he begged Rikuto for mercy. 

"Please," he had pleaded, his voice choked with fear and despair. But Rikuto just watched him, his cruel laughter echoing off the walls as he relished Hiroshi's anguish.

The sight of Hiroshi crying like a helpless child seemed to amuse Rikuto, his eyes glowing with a sadistic delight. 

"Oh, how the innocent weep," he had sneered, taking pleasure in the sight of Hiroshi's suffering. 

Rikuto enjoyed playing these tormenting games with Hiroshi, breaking his spirit bit by bit.

But even in his lowest moment, Hiroshi refused to let Rikuto win. 

Wiping his tears, he stood up, his determination rekindling like a flame within his heart. No matter how brutal the trials, 

how sadistic Rikuto's games, Hiroshi was resolved not to let this demon break him.

In the world he returned to, the memories of his torment served as a stark reminder of the cruelty he had endured. 

The recall of his pleas for mercy and the memory of his tears filled him with a unique blend of sorrow and resolve. 

Each memory of Rikuto's cruel games strengthened his resolve to protect others from such a fate.

Hiroshi's experience had changed him forever, transforming him from a simple, innocent boy into a stalwart defender of the innocent. 

His past tears were now his armor, his pleas for mercy now his battle cry. Despite the nightmarish trials, Hiroshi stood tall, resolute, a beacon of hope in the face of darkness.
