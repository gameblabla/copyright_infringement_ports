# Copyright Infringement NES version
By gameblabla (April 1st 2023)

This is the NES version of my smallish game, Copyright Infringement The Regressive Right.
This has been ported to numerous platforms but now it's finally on the NES, my first proper NES homebrew game in fact!

It tries to make use of DPCM samples.
However due to technical issues, most of it is contained in only 16kb worth of voices !
I believe i managed to get a good compromise despite this...
Should llvm-mos get fixed accordingly, i will update this version.

This uses the MMC3 chip so make sure your NES flashcart or homebrew cart supports it !
