# Copyright Infringement for Excalibur 64

Requires CP/M to run. (it won't run from basic)

A port to an obscure computer kit mostly released in Australia.
Quite a cool name (even the adverts were banking on it) but sadly lackluster tech specs.
Technically you can do 320x288 on this computer by using all PCG banks
but as of writing this, only 160x72 had been implemented within z88dk so far.
Ingame, it's even worse, 80x25 due to a lack of memory and tools to convert
to the hires mode.

As a result, it looks chunky, almost as much as the Exidy Sorcerer version.
There's also no beeper sound due to lack of documentation on it (and z88dk does
not implement 1bit sound on platforms with casette output).


Still, i hope you'll enjoy it. (or not)
