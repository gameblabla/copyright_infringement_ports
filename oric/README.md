# CopyRight Infringement Regressive Right for the Oric Atmos/Oric 1

This is Copyright Infringement : The Regressive Right for the Oric Atmos/Oric 1.
This will not work on the 16k model !

This port was mostly easy to do, the only issue was to find an appropriate graphics converter for the Oric but fortunately osdk provides one (PictConv.exe).

This is designed to be loaded from casette and it takes around 4 minutes to load so be patient.

The animated frames are not compressed this time but for a different reason :
it doesn't actually end up saving much space.
And also, the decompression speed was not fast enough.

Hence in this case, the less faster LZSA2 variant is used for still frames.
The Oric thankfully has ample amount of memory so i was able to include 5 frames of animation,
unlike some platforms where i was stuck with either 3 frames or a very small window.

This is my first time dealing with the Oric and it's quite interesting :
it has similar graphics limitations to the MSX/Colecovision except less colours,
the screen is directly accessible and it has a decent amount of memory (except for the 16K model)L
