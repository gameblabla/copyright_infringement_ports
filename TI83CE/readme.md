### CopyRight Infringement Regressive Right for TI 83 CE

This is a port of my smallish game for the TI 83CE.
It's a decent port all things considered but i didn't put too much effort into it.
Internal resolution for the frames are 160x100 which are then scaled up to 320x200,
on top of being ZX0 compressed.
Thankfully the eZ80 inside has plenty of horse power to do stuff like that.
Also other lower end Z80 machines would be too slow for ZX0 in real time whereas
this is quite capable indeed. 
So much in fact that ZX1 is not even provided in the toolchain, only ZX7 and ZX0.

# Usage

Make sure to transfer vargci.8xv (as an archive, it should do so automatically) and CIRIGHT.8xp.
Once that's done, unarchive the game CIRIGHT.8xp either from the memory screen (2nd + Mem)
or using 2nd+Catalog and then use the UnArchiv command.
