COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT For BK-0010 Electronika
==============================================
Game by gameblabla (2023)
Here is my gay game for the BK-0010 Electronika.
I have ported this game to plenty of platforms (Sinclair QL, VSmile, Exidy Sorcerer, MSX2, Colecovision, ZX Spectrum)
and i couldn't help but feel like this game had to be brought to this Russian/Soviet line of computers.
This was extremely tough as the BK has a tiny amount of memory.
I did discover later about the so-called "Expanded Memory mode" which shrinks the display and increases the memory space
at the expense of resolution... so i decided not to use it for this game.

=====

There are multiple images provided : TAPE, binary and Floppies.
Note that i only tested the binary and not the tape due to MAME not supporting this platform well
