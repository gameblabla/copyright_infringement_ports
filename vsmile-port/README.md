Copyright Infringement for V.Smile
===================================

This is the source code for Copyright Infringement on the V.Smile and compatibles.
This works on MAME at least except there's no sound for now.

# TODO
Test on real hardware more specifically
- Text layer when combined with HICOLOR mode actually works
- PCM sound
- Whenever controls actually get disabled after a minute or so (needs testing)

Usage on real hardware
======================

Use discocart to put the game on a real cartridge.
